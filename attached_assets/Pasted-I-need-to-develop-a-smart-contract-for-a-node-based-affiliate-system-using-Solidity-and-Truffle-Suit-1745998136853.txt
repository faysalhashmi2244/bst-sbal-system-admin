I need to develop a smart contract for a node-based affiliate system using Solidity and Truffle Suite. The contract should implement the following functionality:

## Node Packages Structure
The system should offer these node levels (stored in a struct with these properties):
- Node ID (uint)
- Name (string)
- Price (uint in wei)
- Duration (uint in days)
- Base Reward (uint in wei)
- ROI percentage (uint)
- Active status (bool)

Initial packages (prices should be converted to wei equivalent):

1. 🔥 Ignite Node
   - Price: $100 (100000000000000000000 wei for $100 @ $1 = 1e18 wei)
   - Duration: 20 days
   - Base Reward: $20 (20000000000000000000 wei)
   - ROI: 20%

2. 🔥 Blaze Node
   - Price: $200 
   - Duration: 25 days
   - Base Reward: $45
   - ROI: 22.5%

3. ⚡️ Surge Node
   - Price: $400
   - Duration: 30 days
   - Base Reward: $100
   - ROI: 25%

4. ⚡️ Flux Node
   - Price: $800
   - Duration: 35 days
   - Base Reward: $220
   - ROI: 27.5%

5. ⚙️ Axis Node
   - Price: $1,600
   - Duration: 40 days
   - Base Reward: $460
   - ROI: 28.75%

6. ⚙️ Core Node
   - Price: $3,200
   - Duration: 45 days
   - Base Reward: $990
   - ROI: 30.9%

7. 🌌 Sky Node
   - Price: $5,000
   - Duration: 50 days
   - Base Reward: $1,600
   - ROI: 32%

8. ⏳ Vault Node
   - Price: $7,500
   - Duration: 55 days
   - Base Reward: $2,475
   - ROI: 33%

9. 🛡️ Shield Node
   - Price: $10,000
   - Duration: 60 days
   - Base Reward: $3,600
   - ROI: 35%

10. ☀️ Solar Node
    - Price: $12,000
    - Duration: 65 days
    - Base Reward: $4,320
    - ROI: 36%

11. 🌠 Prime Node
    - Price: $15,000
    - Duration: 70 days
    - Base Reward: $5,550
    - ROI: 37%

## Additional Notes:
1. All dollar amounts should be converted to wei values in the contract
2. Price and reward values should use the same decimal precision
3. Include a function to bulk add initial packages during deployment
4. Duration should be stored in seconds (convert days to seconds)
5. Implement price/reward calculations to prevent rounding errors

Please provide:
1. Complete Solidity contract with all 11 packages pre-configured
2. Migration script that initializes all packages
3. Comprehensive test cases covering all packages
4. View functions to access package details
